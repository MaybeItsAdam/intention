     * The one line that keeps fail-closed honest.

     * With APP_PARTS unverified on every signal, "block only Reels" is in
     * practice "block Instagram" — AppParts gates whenever it cannot tell what
     * is on screen, because the alternative is an app that quietly never
     * blocks. That is the right call, but it means a user can meet a gate they
     * were told they would not meet, and the only other place Intention admits
     * it is a card inside the app they are deliberately not opening. So the
     * gate says it here, where they are actually standing.
     *
     * Deliberately text and nothing else. It is one sentence, it does not
     * cover the coach, and it offers no button — the exit and the settings are
     * the coach's own, already a tap away below this strip, and a second route
     * out of a block is a second thing to get wrong. The two wordings differ
     * because the two causes suggest different repairs: a part this build can
     * never recognise will not start working, where a screen we simply missed
     * may well come back after the next app update.
     *
     * Returns null — and the activity then lays out exactly as it always did —
     * for every block that is not a degraded part verdict.
